# IForgotThat ![Functions ready to be implemented](https://badge.waffle.io/evenh/iforgotthat.png?label=ready&title=Ready "Waffle.io")

A simple TODO app for Android which uses images to remind you of things you would otherwise forget. This is our semester project in [CSC 780](http://apps.sfsu.edu/cgi-bin/sims/classsch.details?row_id=AAAl08AA4AABanvAAb&openu=N&CRSADMIN=R) at [SFSU](http://sfsu.edu) for the Spring 2014 semester.

Take a look at our [idea](https://github.com/evenh/IForgotThat/wiki/Description-of-the-%E2%80%98I-Forgot-That%E2%80%99-app), look at one of the branches or check out our progress in the [journal](https://github.com/evenh/IForgotThat/wiki/Journal).
